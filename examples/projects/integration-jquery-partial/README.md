# Add only what you need from the Kendo UI for jQuery suite within an Angular project

This Kendo UI for Angular sample project demonstrates how to add just the [Kendo UI for jQuery PivotGrid widget](https://demos.telerik.com/kendo-ui/pivotgrid/local-flat-data-binding) in Angular applications. It shows how only the required Kendo UI for jQuery widgets can be added to the Angular project. That approach helps to maintain a smaller bundle size.

The demo is referred to in the [Kendo UI for Angular official documentation](https://www.telerik.com/kendo-angular-ui/components) in the article on [Kendo UI for jQuery integration](https://www.telerik.com/kendo-angular-ui/components/framework/kendo-jquery/).
